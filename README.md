## bat files for easy batch converting images with primtive

### what is it and why should i care?
it's simple and dirty bat files i made for someone who needed to batch convert some of their images using [primitive](https://github.com/fogleman/primitive)

### how to use?
put your images in the "in" folder and use primtive.bat, after the process is complete the converted images can be found in the "out" folder

### what are magick.exe and convert.exe
these are part of the imagemagick program that primitve uses to make gif files out of the process, sort of like a before and after gif starting from a blank page and building the image up one shape at a time

### where did you get the binary or did you build it yourself from source
i did make a binary myself for my personal use but i used the binary that was made from another person on the internet for this repo

### something went wrong, how could i fix it?
i'll try to help if i can but my knowlege of the language is pretty limited so you are better served searching online
